IN THIS APPLICATION THERE I USED DJANGO BACKEND WITH DRF DJANGO REST FRAMEWORK AND FOR FRONT END I USED REACT JS WITH ITS LIBRARIES. FOR DATABASE I USED POSTGRES

TO SET THE DATABASE
You need to install pgadmin and create the databse main events
after that you need to go to the terminal and get into the folder called caldjango 
then make the migrations python manage.py makemigrations 
then python manage.py migrate

you need to download or clone the app and install the requirments or activate the enviroment
First step need to go through the env folder then env>>Scripts>>activate or ./activate
then comeback to main folder and go into caldjango and run the backend server : python manage.py runserver
